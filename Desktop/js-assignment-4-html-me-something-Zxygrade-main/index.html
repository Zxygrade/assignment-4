            <h2> Videogames</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="fun-Paragraph">My first gaming system was a Gameboy Advance SP, that I recieved on my fifth birthday. I do play a
               plethora of videogames and genres. The games closest to both my heart and childhood however are the
               pokemon games. I played at least one from each generation excluding Ultra Sun and Moon as well as Sword
               and Shield. But Im back on track with the latest addition to the mainline games, Pokemon Violet. Of
               course those aren't the only games I play. I enjoy single player games like "God of War"(looking forward
               to playing Ragnorok), battle royales like Apex Legends, and multiplayer Co-op games like "Tiny Tina's
               Wonderlands" or "It Takes Two"</p>

            <h2> Reading</h2>
            <p> Reading has alyways been one of my favorite past times since I was a wee lad. I started off with reading
               informational books on different snakes, spiders and lizard species in Kindergarten. Then I moved on to
               generic nonfiction comedy story books in elementary Like Dairy of a wimpy Kid. Middleschool I moved into
               the Fantasy genre where I have stayed and found so much pleasure. For most of my highchool career I was
               reading one or more books a day during class and could finish them. Whether they were 300 pages or 800
               pages.</p>

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>When I was younger I would sit in the kitchen and watch my mother cook and my old man used to cook us me
               and my younger brother breakfast every Saturday just sausage and eggs. So when I was old enough to be
               trusted to use the stove I was extremely excited to learn. I was not very good to start considering I was
               new and young but I enjoyed it. It wasn't till I got my first(technically third) job that I stopped
               enjoying cooking and wouldn't cook for myself for almost 4 years in a serious fashoin at least. I was a
               grill team lead at McDonalds at that time and it sucked all thejoy of cooking out of me. it wasn't until
               last year that I started cooking again and enjoying it. Baking and cooking have been something I find a
               real connection to and help with both my mood and my hunger in all honesty. Today I plan on making
               snickerdoodle cookies for the first time and Im really excited to find out how they turn out!</p>
